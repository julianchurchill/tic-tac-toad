Backlog
=======

... - Show the user an empty board, stating 'Your turn'.
- Human vs human game - user should be able to make alternating moves for either side until the board is full

- Tests
  - Implement Board
    - BoardIterator ?  instead of traversing by Coord which perpetuates a primitive obsession (x, y, width, height)...
  - Implement basic BoardModel
